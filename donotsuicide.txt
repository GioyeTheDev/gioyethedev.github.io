Hey! Don't betray your own life, read this instead:

Say NO to Suicide
Suicide is never the answer
Be brave, and never quit
Accept life, reject suicide
Suicide: Don’t even think about it
Your suicide will kill your family too
Respect your life
Suicide is a problem, and not a solution.
Kill your problems, not yourself
Suicide is never the answer
Suicide is permanent, problems are temporary
Forget suicide and remember your family
Suicide: Don’t do injustice to yourself
Suicides destroy our families, our societies and our nation.
Every life matters
You have survived so many odds, this is just another one.
Be a fighter, choose life
Be your own guide, stop suicide
Believe in GOD and move on
All pain will pass
Don’t allow your problems to haunt you to death. face them and find a solution.
Never lose hope
Don’t quit, life is worth living
Think positive, forget suicide
Every problem has a solution and suicide is certainly not one of them.
Face problem, don’t run from them
Get rid of problems, not your life
Life is a marathon. Complete it, don’t quit
Life is precious, Value it.
Give life a chance
Hold on to Hope
If there is life, there is hope.
It cannot end this way
It’s just a bad phase
It’s always too early to quit.
Keep fighting
Keep going
Kill stress before it kills you
Life finds a way, just give it a chance
Life is a gift. Preserve it. Cherish it.
If life’s a joke, laugh at your problems
Live another day, there are endless possibilities.
Live life, don’t kill life.
Love life, Live life. Say NO to suicide.
Never never never give up
Once you choose hope, anything’s possible
One suicide kills many hearts. Don’t do it
Save yourself, kill problems
Do not destroy what you can’t create. Your life is precious.
Your life matters
Your children are waiting for you
Think about your parents
Your family loves you
Your family needs you
Throw your problems out of the window, not yourself
Tomorrow brings a brand-new day!
When you got no reason to live… just make one, don’t die
Who will take care of your family once you are gone?
You are part of the greater plan…don’t miss it
When you feel like giving up, just remember the reason why you held on for so long.

“If life’s a joke, then suicide’s a bad punch line.” — Louise Erdrich
